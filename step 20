#reeborg has to build walls other wise the building will flood. The position of missing wall section changes as does the dimesnion but not shape of room.
So the key was figuring out that there is always 6 left turns. So I used as indicator to know when to stop.







from library import turn_right, turn_around, find_north


x = 0
y = 0
tl = 0
# need to figure out how to stop in correct spot

def stay_dry():
    while not object_here():
        global tl
        if tl >= 6:
            move()
            move()
            break
        if wall_on_right() and front_is_clear():
            move()
        elif not wall_on_right():
            move()
            if wall_on_right():
                turn_around()
                move()
                turn_left()
                if front_is_clear():
                    build_wall()
                    turn_left()
            elif not wall_on_right():
                turn_around()
                move()
                turn_left()
                if front_is_clear():
                    move()
                
        else:
            turn_left()
            tl += 1
            print(tl)
                
think(1)                
for x in range(3):
    move()
turn_right()

move()
stay_dry()
